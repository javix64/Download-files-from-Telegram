I didn't do this script. Somebody gave it to me for download content from a spanish books group.
I will share it, because is useful.

## To keep in mind:
- Create new database: CREATE DATABASE books;
- Create table: CREATE TABLE books_info ( doc_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR( 200 ), path VARCHAR ( 200 ), size_kb BIGINT);
- Use your user, password, host, database on line 64-68, 96-100
- Change the path on line 36
- Use your api_id and your api_hash on line 14 & 15.

## This is all.
If i don't know about python programming, and i did it, you can do it.
Have a good day.
